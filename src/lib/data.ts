I'm a Software Engineer at Hypotenuse AI (YC S20), where I work end-to-end across the stack — fast React frontends, scalable backends, and DevOps — while shipping AI features that put generative models to real use for enterprise clients. Off the clock I write a lot of systems-level Rust. I care about building things people actually use, and making them fast.",
